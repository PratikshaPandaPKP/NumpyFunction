# NumpyFunction
Like pandas, numpy is also one of the most important library which is used widely in Python for Data Analysis and Data Science. NumPy, short for Numerical Python, provides an efficient interface for storing and manipulating extensive data in the Python programming language.   
Created this on July 2019, created an array dataset with numbers and performed numpy function to know more about numpy. With the help of numpy function, I found the mean and variance, I also plotted the values from the dataset and observed the standard normal distribution.
